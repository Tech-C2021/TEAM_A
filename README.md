# Kakaku.com Scraper

## Requirements

- Docker

## Usage

- If using `Linux` or `Mac`, save the aliases for easy usage.

```bash
source aliases.sh
```

- If using windows, you may check `aliases.sh` to know which command to use to run the program.
- Execute `rp` to start build and run main.rb inside the container.
- If the rankings for mobile phones are not yet saved in the db for the current date, it will automatically save it before showing today's rankings.
